# "Show DoH Flow": DNS and netflow correlator

This tool was inspired by a need to see whether netflows correlated with DNS lookups, which in turn is motivated by
the push for _DNS over HTTP_. DoH apparently appeals to people who want to trade visibility into DNS traffic by their
coffee shop for visibility into that traffic by advertising and cloud infrastructure providers. On the other hand
that local DNS traffic is utilized in offices and other controlled access environments as an access control / auditing
mechanism.
